### Installation:
Simply move the colorscheme you would like to use, whether it be the dark or gray one, into your Vim/Neovim colorscheme folder, A [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) colorscheme is also included.

### Too Colorful?
Try out the [gunmetal.vim](https://github.com/co1ncidence/gunmetal) gunmetal, it uses the same color palette as mountaineer but aims to highlight only important syntax elements and keep the user free of distractions.
